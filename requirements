User should
 - add first and last days of visits (according to passport stamps)
 - be able to add more than 1 trip
 - define the dates of future trip

 Past trips:
  - first day of valid data = first day of future trip - 180
  - days before do not count
  - all days days sum up and are substracted from allowed 90

Future trip: 
 - check if user can enter the EU on the defined day
 - of not: refusal and proposal of a new date
 - check if user can spend all the days in the EU
 - if not  - refusal, propose allowed number of days

Math:
 - data needed:
  - date of the trip - 1st day of planned trip (1d)
  - number of days OR date of coming back (last day of the trip)
  - dates (1st and last days of trips for thr last 180 days)



 - operations:
    A. check data validation:
        - last day >= first day (if not  - error alert)
        - date of future trip can be today, in future or in the past


    B. count days of trip within 180 days

        a. define margin_day = 1d - 180
        b. if (margin_day < first_day && margin_day < last_day) 
            {trip_count  = last_day - first_day + 1} 
            else if (margin_day > first_day && margin_day < last_day){
                trip_count = last_day - margin_day + 1
            } else if (margin_day > first_day && margin_day > last_day){
                trip_count = 0;
            }
    
    C. Count total days used 
        total_trip_days =+ trip_count

    D. Count total days used + planned days 
       total_trip_days =+ last_day_future - first_day_future + 1 - number_of_days

    E. Compare fact_trip_days and future_trip_days to 90
        - if (FATD < 90 && FUTD < 90) {
            "Have a nice trip!"
        }

        - if (FATD > 90){
            "You can enter the EU (FATD - 91) later, on (future first date + (FATD - 91)). Please make changes to your plans"
        }

        - if (FATD < 90 && FUTD > 90) {
            "Please plan a shorter trip to avoid fines. You can spend in the EU () days and return on ____ or move your trip to later date () to spend the number of days you planned"
        }
